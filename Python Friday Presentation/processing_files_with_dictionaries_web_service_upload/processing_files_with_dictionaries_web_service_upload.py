# As a beginner Python learner, your task is to create a Python script that processes text files, converts their contents into dictionaries, and uploads the data to a running web service. Follow these steps:

# Set up your environment:
    # Install Python if you haven't already
    # Install the necessary libraries (requests for HTTP requests)

# Create a Python script that does the following:
    # a. Reads all .txt files from a specified directory (e.g., /data/feedback)
    # b. Processes each file to extract relevant information (e.g., title, name, date, feedback)
    # c. Creates a dictionary for each file, with the extracted information as key-value pairs
    # d. Uses the requests library to send a POST request to a web service endpoint
    # e. Uploads the dictionary data to the web service

    # Here's a basic structure to get you started:

        # import os
        # import requests

        # def process_file(file_path):
        #     # Process the file content and return a dictionary
        #     pass

        # def upload_to_web_service(data):
        #     # Send POST request to the web service
        #     pass

        # # Main execution
        # feedback_dir = '/data/feedback'
        # files = os.listdir(feedback_dir)

        # for file in files:
        #     file_path = os.path.join(feedback_dir, file)
        #     feedback_dict = process_file(file_path)
            
        #     if feedback_dict:
        #         upload_to_web_service(feedback_dict)
        #         print(f"Uploaded feedback from {file}")
        #     else:
        #         print(f"Failed to process {file}")

        # print("Processing complete.")
# Implement the process_file function to read the content of each text file and create a dictionary with the extracted information.
# Implement the upload_to_web_service function using the requests library to send POST requests to your web service endpoint.
# Handle potential errors during file processing and web service upload.
# Test your script thoroughly with sample data.

# Key Points to Consider:
    # Understand how to read and write files in Python
    # Learn how to use dictionaries effectively
    # Understand HTTP POST requests and how to format data for sending
    # Practice error handling techniques



# REQUIRED FILES
# text_processing.py: The main script that reads text files, creates dictionaries, and uploads data to a web service
    # Defines functions to process text files and create dictionaries.
    # Uses the config.json file for storing API endpoints.
    # Implements error handling when making HTTP requests.
    # Processes all .txt files in the specified directory.
# config.json: A configuration file for storing API endpoints and other settings
    # Stores the web service URL as a JSON object.
    # Allows easy configuration changes without modifying the Python script.
# requirements.txt: A file listing the required Python packages
    # Specifies the required Python package (requests) along with its version.
    # Helps in setting up the development environment by installing the necessary dependencies.

# To run this solution:
    # Save all three files in the same directory.
    # Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

# Install the required package by running:
    # pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the main script:
    # python text_processing.py

# This solution demonstrates:
    # Reading text files
    # Creating dictionaries to represent file metadata and content
    # Using a configuration file for flexibility
    # Making HTTP POST requests to upload data
    # Basic error handling

# Remember to replace the placeholder web service URL in config.json with your actual API endpoint before running the script. Also, ensure you have the necessary permissions to read the input directory and make outbound network connections when uploading data.
