# As a beginner Python learner, your task is to demonstrate your ability to generate Python scripts using AI assistance. Follow these steps:

    # Choose a simple application idea, such as a basic calculator or a simple game like "Rock, Paper, Scissors".
    # Use an AI coding assistant tool (like GitHub Copilot, Kite, or Codota) to help you write the initial structure of your script.
    # Implement the following features in your script:
        # A main function that serves as the entry point
        # At least two other functions related to your chosen application (e.g., addition/subtraction functions for a calculator)
        # A loop that allows users to interact with your program multiple times
    # Write clear comments explaining each function and key parts of your code.
    # Include error handling to deal with potential input errors or unexpected situations.
    # Use proper indentation and follow Python style guidelines.
    # Test your script thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
    
    # Here's a basic structure to get you started:

            # def main():
            #     # Main function to run the program
            #     pass

            # def add_numbers(a, b):
            #     # Function to add two numbers
            #     pass

            # def subtract_numbers(a, b):
            #     # Function to subtract two numbers
            #     pass

            # # Main execution
            # if __name__ == "__main__":
            #     main()

    # Run your script and observe its output.

# Key Points to Consider:
    # Understand how AI coding assistants work and their limitations
    # Learn to write clear, descriptive comments
    # Practice error handling techniques
    # Understand the structure of Python programs, including functions and main execution block

# CSV Data Structure with Four Columns
# Name: The student's name
# Maths Grade: The grade achieved in Maths (assuming a grading scale similar to UK GCSEs)
# Science Grade: The grade achieved in Science
# English Grade: The grade achieved in English

    # Name,Maths Grade,Science Grade,English Grade
    # Alice,85,Y4:0,90
    # Bob,78,X2:0,95
    # Charlie,92,O3:0,88
    # David,76,N1:0,92
    # Eve,89,P2:0,91

# To run this script:
    # Save the main.py file in the same directory as your CSV file.
    # Ensure the student_grades.csv file is in the same directory as main.py.
    # Install the required csv module (it comes pre-installed with Python).
    # Run the script using python main.py.

# This solution demonstrates several key concepts:
    # Reading a CSV file using Python's built-in csv module.
    # Using functions to organize code logically.
    # Error handling for file reading operations.
    # Calculating averages using zip() and sum().
    # Finding the highest overall grade using max() and next().
    # Formatting output for readability.
