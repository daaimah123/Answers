### Using fetch to render data from an API - exercise

Your friend is planning a big party, and you want to help. You found an amazing free API that gives a random drink for each call, and you want to use it to help your friend with new ideas for drinks for the night.

Your task for the day is to use the CocktailDB API to make the button "Find a new Drink" work rendering the RandomDrink component that you will see in the components directory. 

- Hint 1: That component is not being called in the App.js component
- Hint 2: The URL that you should use is: https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php
- Hint 3: You need use State to control the information from your API

Bonus
Can you bring the name of the random cocktail? Your friend wants to share that information with the party's guests.

Learning objectives
Using fetch, make a request to the cocktail API, get the data for one drink instruction, and display it in the App.js component using the component.
