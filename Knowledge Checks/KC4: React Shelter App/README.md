## Let's help our local shelter!
Our local shelter needs identification cards for all the animals ready to be adopted. We volunteer your time to help with some of those.

Write a new component called AnimalCard that accepts 3 props ```title, description, and imageUrl.```

Inside the component, render the title in an `<h1>` tag, the description in a `<p>` tag, and pass the `imageUrl` into an img tag like `<img src={imageUrl}/>`. Make five instances of this component with different props (data).

#### Note: You can use any image that you want. The title should be a name, and the description should be a little about the animal. 

#### Bonus: Use `alt` text with props for your images.
