/*
Calculate the Average Age: First, we need to calculate the average age of all friends. This involves summing up all the ages and dividing by the number of friends.
Add Initials Property: Next, we'll add a property to each friend object that stores their initials. This requires taking the first letter of each name part (first and last names).
Filter Friends Older Than Average Age: We'll create a function to filter out friends who are older than the calculated average age.
List Initials and Age: Finally, we'll format a list of strings showing each friend's initials and age.
Let's implement these steps in code:*/

// Step 1: Add Initials Property
// We'll map over the myFriends array to add an initials property to each friend object.

const friendsWithInitials = myFriends.map(friend => ({
    ...friend,
    initials: `${friend.firstname[0]}${friend.lastname[0]}`,
}));


// Step 2: Calculate the Average Age

// Calculate average age
const totalAge = myFriends.reduce((sum, friend) => sum + friend.age, 0);
const avgAge = totalAge / myFriends.length;



// Step 3: Filter Friends Older Than Average Age
// Now, we'll create a function to filter friends based on their age compared to the average.

function getOlderThanAverage() {
    return friendsWithInitials.filter(friend => friend.age > avgAge);
}


// Step 4: List Initials and Age
// Finally, we'll format a list of strings showing each friend's initials and age.

function listInitialsWithAge() {
    return getOlderThanAverage().map(friend => `${friend.initials}: ${friend.age}`);
}

// console.log(listInitialsWithAge()); // Expected output: 'AB: 35, SW: 45, AE: 38, IH: 46'


/*Explanation
Calculating Average Age: We use the reduce method to sum up all ages and then divide by the number of friends to get the average.
Adding Initials: By mapping over the array, we add a new property initials to each friend object, combining the first letters of their first and last names.
Filtering Friends: The getOlderThanAverage function filters the array of friends to only those whose age is greater than the average age.
Listing Initials and Age: The listInitialsWithAge function formats the filtered list of friends into a string, displaying each friend's initials and age.
